# ScrapsAI
Randomly got back into screeps decided to play with AI stuff again.

The idea is to build out "Overlords" Which handle tasks, operations, etc for rooms. These overlords are then led by the main Overseer which is the main loop.

## Building

A build script powered by Rollup.js compiles the folders down into a single minified `main.js` this is compiled to the `dist` folder, I then have a bash script move that file to my screeps folder
